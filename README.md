# backends

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of backends is to provide a web API that lists all known DBI
backends. It is implemented as a set of static JSON files

## Usage

### Query all packages

``` r
all <- httr::GET("https://r-dbi.github.io/backends/all.json")
httr::stop_for_status(all)
all_df <- httr::content(all, flatten = TRUE, simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

``` r
fix_url <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) == 0 || anyNA(x)) {
    x <- ""
  }
  glue::glue_collapse(x, ", ")
}

all_df$url <- purrr::map_chr(all_df$url, fix_url)
all_df$bugs <- purrr::map_chr(all_df$bugs, fix_url)
all_df
```

| dittodb           | 0.1.3    | A Test Environment for Database Requests                                              | Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote databases can be painful. Although the interaction with R is usually relatively simple (e.g. data(frames) passed to and from a database), because they rely on a separate service and the data there, testing them can be difficult to set up, unsustainable in a continuous integration environment, or impossible without replicating an entire production cluster. This package addresses that by allowing you to make recordings from your database interactions and then play them back while testing (or in other contexts) all without needing to spin up or have access to the database your code would typically connect to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2020-10-10 | Jonathan Keane <jkeane@gmail.com>                            | Apache License (\>= 2.0)          | <https://dittodb.jonkeane.com/>, <https://github.com/ropensci/dittodb>                                           | <https://github.com/ropensci/dittodb/issues>               |

The objective is to define a standard interface so users can retrieve time series data from various sources with a simple, common, set of commands, and so programs can be written to be portable with respect to the data source. The SQL implementations also provide a database table design, so users needing to set up a time series database have a reasonably complete way to do this easily. The interface provides for a variety of options with respect to the representation of time series in R. The interface, and the SQL implementations, also handle vintages of time series data (sometime called editions or real-time data). There is also a (not yet well tested) mechanism to handle multilingual data documentation.

#> 
#> $description
#> [1] "An interface to 'Azure Data Explorer', also known as 'Kusto', a fast, highly scalable data exploration service from Microsoft: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/>. Includes 'DBI' and 'dplyr' interfaces, with the latter modelled after the 'dbplyr' package, whereby queries are translated from R into the native 'KQL' query language and executed lazily. On the admin side, the package extends the object framework provided by 'AzureRMR' to support creation and deletion of databases, and management of database principals. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages."
