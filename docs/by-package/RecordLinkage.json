  "description": "Provides functions for linking and deduplicating data sets. Methods based on a stochastic approach are implemented as well as classification algorithms from the machine learning domain. For details, see our paper \"The RecordLinkage Package: Detecting Errors in Data\" Sariyar M / Borg A (2010) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2010-017>.",
